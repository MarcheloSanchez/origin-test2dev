# Inbox Processing

1. **Review Daily**
   - Open `+` (Inbox).
   - Process each note using Capture and Clarify playbooks.
2. **Decide**
   - Project → move to `02-PARA/100-PROJECTS`.
   - Area → move to `02-PARA/200-AREAS`.
   - Resource → move to `02-PARA/300-RESOURCES`.
   - Zettel → move to `02-PARA/300-RESOURCES/310 Knowledge/Dots` with UID.
   - Trash or archive if unnecessary.
3. **Add Metadata**
   - Apply templates.
   - Fill frontmatter fields from `Schema.md`.
4. **Empty Inbox**
   - Aim for zero items at end of day.
