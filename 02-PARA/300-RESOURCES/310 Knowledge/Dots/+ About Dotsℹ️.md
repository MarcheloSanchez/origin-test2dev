- **Složka pro všechny „kousky znalostí“ – základní stavební jednotky tvého myšlení.**
- Dots = poznámky typu:
    - Ideas (nápady)
    - Concepts (koncepty, definice)
    - People (osoby, profily)
    - Quotes (citáty)
    - Tools (nástroje)
    - Statements (tvrzení, fakta)
    - Things (věci, objekty)
- Každý Dot je jako „post-it“ – rychle zachytíš, později propojíš nebo rozvineš.
- Dots mohou být samostatné nebo propojené s Efforts, Sources, MOCs apod.
- **Tip:** Pravidelně používej „Recall a Reflect“ – projdi staré Dots, destiluj, rozvíjej, propojuj.

### A Dots is a piece of Knowledge. 

Think of it like a Post It Note with everything you have written down which lives in a folder inside your vault. 🗃️

---
## Helpful when;
- You need to build and connect knowledge or store information in your vault. 

Dots can be in your own words or a combination of facts and your interpretation of the subject or topic. Dots take a bit of getting used to because you can file them away and forget about them. 

>[!tip] 
>Try use Recall and Reflect often to flush out cards to distill and express to show your work!

The dots folder is one of my favorite places because it has *umami*. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitterness—and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind. 

***Q: So, what are "dots"?*** 
Anything that is a bit of knowledge that you might call a "thing" or a "statement about things". 

Yes, the definition is not rigid, but it works.
