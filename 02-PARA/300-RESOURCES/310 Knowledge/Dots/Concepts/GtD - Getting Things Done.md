## 📌 **What is GTD (Getting Things Done)?**
GTD is a productivity framework developed by David Allen that helps you effectively manage tasks, reduce stress, and improve productivity through clear and organized workflows.

## 📋 **The 5-Step Method for Managing Workflow:**
### 1. 📥 **Collecting (Corral Your “Stuff”)**
- Capture **everything** that grabs your attention, big or small, personal or professional.
- Aim: Get items out of your head into a reliable collection tool (e.g., inbox, notepad, app).
**Example:**
- Notes, tasks, emails, ideas, reminders, anything incomplete.
---
### 2. 🔄 **Processing (Getting “In” to Empty)**
- Regularly empty your collected "stuff."
- Clarify: Define **what each item means** and what to **do** with it.
**Key questions:**
- What is this?
- Is it actionable?
- What's the next action?
**2-Minute Rule:**  
If it takes less than **2 minutes**, do it immediately.

---
### 3. 🗂️ **Organizing (Setting Up the Right Buckets)**
- Organize processed items into clear categories:
    - 📅 **Calendar:** Time-specific or date-specific tasks.
    - ✅ **Next Actions:** Tasks to be done as soon as possible.
    - 🚧 **Projects:** Complex items needing multiple actions.
    - ⏳ **Waiting For:** Tasks awaiting someone else's action.
    - 📌 **Someday/Maybe:** Ideas or tasks for later.
    - 📖 **Reference:** Non-actionable useful info/materials.
**Practical Examples:**
- Projects: "Plan vacation", "Write report".
- Waiting: "Awaiting colleague’s reply".
- Calendar: "Doctor appointment on Thursday".
- Someday/Maybe: "Learn piano", "Visit Japan".
---
### 4. 🔍 **Reviewing (Keeping Your System Functional)**
- Regularly (weekly, daily) review your lists and calendars.
- Ensure your system is current and relevant.
- Adjust priorities, clear out completed tasks, and clarify actions.
**Typical review schedule:**
- **Daily:** Scan next actions, calendar, and waiting-for lists.
- **Weekly:** Deeper review of projects, actions, and backlog.
---
### 5. 🚀 **Doing (Making the Best Action Choices)**
- Decide what task to execute based on:
    - **Context:** Where am I? (office, home, online)
    - **Time available:** How long do I have?
    - **Energy available:** How fresh or tired am I?
    - **Priority:** What has the most impact?
---
## 💡 **Practicing GTD (Mind Like Water)**
- **Capture everything**: Place it immediately into your inbox.
- **Empty regularly**: Define clearly and act quickly or organize appropriately.
- **Mind Like Water:** Be present, clear, and ready for what's next without unnecessary stress or distraction.

## 🎯 **Workflow Chart (Decision Making):**
- Identify "stuff" → put in "Inbox".
- Clarify: What is it?
    - Not actionable → Trash, Someday/Maybe, or Reference.
    - Actionable:
        - Less than 2 min → Do now.
        - Delegate → Waiting For list.
        - More than 2 min → Next Actions, Projects, or Calendar.

### **Decision tree simplified:**

`Stuff ➜ Inbox ➜ Is actionable?     
`├─ No ➜ Trash / Someday-Maybe / Reference     
`└─ Yes ➜ Less than 2 min? Do it now         
`   ├─ Longer? Delegate or Schedule
`   └─ Multi-step? Projects`

## 🛠️ **Support Tools for GTD:**

## 🚩 **Key GTD Principles:**

---
## 🗒️ **Summary:**

GTD helps you maintain clarity and effectiveness by managing tasks systematically, thereby reducing stress and boosting productivity. Using structured lists, regular reviews, and clear next actions, you'll have greater control and peace of mind.
