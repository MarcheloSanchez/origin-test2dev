Love what you‚Äôve got. I‚Äôd level it up in four ways:

1. make the **context machine-readable** (inline fields the queries can see),
    
2. add a tiny **Quality Gate / DoD** for each type,
    
3. drop in **self-updating widgets** (backlinks, related, open tasks),
    
4. keep **headings consistent** and short so notes scan fast.

> [!check]- ‚úÖ Quality Gate
> - Success criteria set  
> - At least 1 milestone + 1 next action  
> - Linked to parent MOC or Area  
> - Risk or dependency noted

> [!todo]- üìå Open Tasks (around this note)
> - je zvl√°≈°tn√≠, ≈æe to ukazuje TODO z tƒõch p≈ôedchoz√≠ch 
```dataview
TASK
FROM ""
WHERE !completed AND (contains(file.inlinks, this.file.link) OR contains(file.outlinks, this.file.link))
SORT due ASC
```

## Why this helps
- **Inline fields** (`Priority:: ‚Ä¶`) are queryable like YAML but live in the body where you think.  
- **Quality Gates** stop half-done notes from polluting dashboards.  
- **Backlinks & tasks widgets** make each note a tiny control panel.  
- **Consistent H2s** keep navigation predictable across types.
