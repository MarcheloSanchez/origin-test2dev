## Board Settings & Configuration

### Essential Settings
- **Enable card checkboxes**: For task completion tracking
- **Set WIP limits**: Prevent workflow bottlenecks
- **Configure date formats**: Consistent date handling
- **Enable archive mode**: Automatic completed card management

### Recommended WIP Limits
- **Processing**: 3-5 cards
- **Research**: 2-3 cards
- **Development**: 1-2 cards
- **Review**: 2-4 cards

## Automation & Workflows

### Daily Review Process
1. Process inbox items (5-10 minutes)
2. Move cards through workflow
3. Update priorities and deadlines
4. Archive completed items

### Weekly Workflow Optimization
1. Analyze bottlenecks in workflow
2. Adjust WIP limits as needed
3. Review and update templates
4. Clean up archived items

### Monthly System Review
1. Evaluate board effectiveness
2. Modify column structure if needed
3. Update automation rules
4. Review and refine processes

## Integration with PKM Systems

## Performance Optimization

### Best Practices
1. **Keep boards focused**: One clear purpose per board
2. **Limit card complexity**: Simple, actionable items
3. **Regular maintenance**: Weekly cleanup and optimization
4. **Use templates**: Consistent card formatting
5. **Monitor flow**: Track cycle times and bottlenecks

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Too many columns (creates decision paralysis)
- Unclear card descriptions
- Ignoring WIP limits
- Inconsistent card formatting
- Neglecting regular reviews

## Advanced Features

### Custom Card Colors
Use tags to automatically color-code cards:
- `#urgent` → Red
- `#important` → Orange  
- `#research` → Blue
- `#writing` → Green
- `#review` → Purple

### Cross-Board Linking
Connect related cards across different boards:
```markdown
Related: [[Board Name#Card Title]]
Dependencies: [[Project Board#Prerequisite Task]]
```

### Metadata Fields
Add structured data to cards:
```yaml
---
type: research
priority: high
due_date: 2024-01-15
estimated_hours: 4
tags: [research, analysis, urgent]
---
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Cards stuck in columns**: Check WIP limits and dependencies
2. **Workflow bottlenecks**: Analyze and redistribute work
3. **Outdated information**: Implement regular review cycles
4. **Overwhelming boards**: Simplify and focus scope

### Performance Issues
- Reduce number of cards per board
- Archive completed items regularly
- Optimize CSS for better rendering
- Use folder scoping for large vaults

## Mobile Optimization

### Mobile-Friendly Practices
1. **Shorter card titles**: Better mobile display
2. **Essential information first**: Important details at top
3. **Minimal formatting**: Reduces complexity
4. **Touch-friendly buttons**: Larger interactive elements

### Responsive Design Considerations
- Vertical card layout on mobile
- Simplified navigation
- Reduced visual complexity
- Optimized touch interactions

## Collaboration Features

### Team Boards
- **Shared responsibility**: Clear ownership indicators
- **Status communication**: Regular updates and comments
- **Conflict resolution**: Clear process for changes
- **Access control**: Appropriate permissions

### Review Processes
- **Peer review workflows**: Structured feedback loops
- **Quality gates**: Checkpoints before progression
- **Approval processes**: Clear authorization steps
- **Documentation**: Change logs and decisions

## Conclusion

Implementing an effective PKM KANBAN system requires careful planning, consistent execution, and regular optimization. Start with simple structures and gradually add complexity as needed. Focus on workflow efficiency and knowledge connectivity to maximize the benefits of your PKM system.

Remember: The best PKM system is the one you actually use consistently. Start simple, iterate regularly, and adapt to your changing needs.
