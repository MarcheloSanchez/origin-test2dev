# 0. Choosing a System (Why & When)
**What problem are you solving? Pick the system by the primary question.**
- **GTD** — _What should I do next?_ Manage commitments, next actions, and reviews. Use when you’re drowning in inputs or need reliable execution.
- **PARA** — _Where does this note/file live so I’ll find it later?_ Organize knowledge and project assets. Use when retrieval is slow or your vault feels messy.
- **Zettelkasten** — _How do I turn reading into original insights?_ Use for research/learning; create small linked notes in `+/`.
- **Personal Kanban** — _What’s in progress and where are bottlenecks?_ Visualize flow, set WIP limits (3–5). Great for delivery weeks or team visibility.
- **Eisenhower / Now–Next–Later** — _What’s important vs. urgent right now?_ Fast triage lens; use for daily/weekly planning, not long-term tracking.
- **OKRs** — _What outcomes matter this quarter?_ Align 3–5 objectives with measurable KRs; review weekly.
- **Time Blocking / Pomodoro** — _When will I do focused work?_ Put deep work on the calendar; helpful on meeting-heavy days.
- **Johnny Decimal** — _How do we keep huge shared files navigable?_ Numbered ranges for large repositories or teams; optional for solo vaults.
**Decision flow**
1. Need to decide actions → **GTD**
2. Need to store/find info → **PARA**
3. Need to develop ideas → **Zettelkasten**
4. Too much WIP / need visibility → **Kanban**
5. Too many urgencies → **Eisenhower/NNL**
6. Quarterly direction → **OKRs**
7. Protect focus time → **Time Blocking**
8. Massive shared files → **Johnny Decimal**
**How it maps to your Obsidian**
- **GTD**: Tasks queries (`#next`, `#waiting`, `#someday`), Weekly Review note, Rule of 3 in Daily.
- **PARA**: `Efforts/` (projects), `Areas/`, `Resources/`, `Archive/`, plus `00-Inbox/`, `05 Calendar/Daily/`, `+/`.
- **Zettelkasten**: atomic notes in `+/`, backlinks & MOCs.
- **Kanban**: Kanban plugin on a per‑project note or a vault‑level Now–Next–Later board.
- **Eisenhower**: one triage note with four quadrants; clear in <10 min.
- **OKRs**: quarterly note under `Areas/` linking to `Efforts/` projects & KRs.
- **Time Blocking**: Daily template section with time blocks.
- **Johnny Decimal**: only if you standardize a shared drive.
**Anti‑patterns to avoid**
- Tracking tasks inside PARA folders → keep tasks in notes but _run_ them via **GTD** views.
- Micro‑tasks bloat → write real next actions; group steps under a project.
- "Resources" landfill → prune by last‑touched; add a quarterly cleanup query.
- Too many systems at once → start with **GTD‑lite + PARA**, add others intentionally.
**Starter mixes**
- **Solo maker**: GTD‑lite + PARA + Daily; add Time Blocking on deep‑work days.
- **Research sprint**: add Zettelkasten; schedule discovery blocks.
- **Delivery sprint**: add Kanban + WIP limit 3–5; tie cards to `Efforts/`.
- **Quarterly push**: add OKR page; 3–5 projects max.
