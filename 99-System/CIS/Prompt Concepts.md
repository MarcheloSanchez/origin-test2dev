# Template with description and examples 
---
```
1. **Provide Clear Context**  
   Briefly summarize the topic or reason for your request.  
   > Example: "I have a set of distances in miles that I need converted to kilometers."

2. **State Your Goal**  
   Explicitly mention the outcome or solution you seek.  
   > Example: "My goal is to get each distance in kilometers with a precise conversion."

3. **Use Examples**  
   Give one or two sample inputs/outputs that illustrate the final format or style.  
   > Example: "10 miles → 16.09 km"

4. **Specify Any Constraints**  
   Mention constraints like precision, formatting, or limitations.  
   > Example: "Please use at least two decimal places."

5. **Include Detailed Steps (If Needed)**  
   If you want a step-by-step breakdown of the method or calculation, request it.  
   > Example: "Show the formula or reasoning steps."

6. **Ask for Clarification (If Needed)**  
   Invite the system to ask follow-up questions if anything is ambiguous.  
   > Example: "If details are unclear, please ask."

7. **Define Ambiguous Terms**  
   Provide intended meanings for any term that might have multiple interpretations.  
   > Example: "By 'distances,' I mean overland driving distances."

8. **Reference Prior Context**  
   If relevant, mention or link to earlier conversations or data.  
   > Example: "We previously discussed approximate conversions for short walking distances."

9. **Specify Format**  
   Clearly state whether you want bullet points, tables, JSON, etc.  
   > Example: "Please provide a bullet list of the final results."

10. **Offer Feedback**  
   State you’ll give corrections or clarifications if the system misunderstands.  
   > Example: "If the formatting or calculations are off, I'll clarify."
