## üí°Prompt [NOTE]
This is a reference template demonstrating every available category and subcategory.
When creating a *real* prompt, pick **one category** and a **small set of matching subcategories**, then remove the rest.

## üìùDescription 
Use this note as a cookbook to copy the values you want into new prompt notes. Keep your normal structure and just prune the lists.

## üìãInstructions 
```ENG
Select the single best "prompt_category" for your prompt.
Then choose 1‚Äì3 "prompt_subcategory" values that logically belong to that category.
Update "prompt_type", "difficulty", "audience", and Bloom "intent" to match the purpose.
```

```CZ

```

## Feedback/Evaluation
Are category and subcategory consistent?

Is the chosen Bloom intent aligned with the task?

Could the output format (format/tone/length) be specified more precisely?
